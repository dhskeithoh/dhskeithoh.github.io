<h1> My after school life </h1>
<p> My CCA is volleyball, out of the 6 different positions in volleyball, my position is Open Spiker.I started out playing volleyball at the age of 10, i thought this would had been easy as i was one of the larger players.However, to my surprise, many of the good players players werent very tall and they had started playing volleyball much earlier than i had. </p>
